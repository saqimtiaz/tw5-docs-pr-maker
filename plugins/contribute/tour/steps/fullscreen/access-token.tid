! Access token

* A ~GitHub access token allows contributions to be made on your behalf. 
* The access token you provide will be saved in your browser.
* The same access token will be reused for future contributions until it expires.

The link below will open the ~GitHub page for creating an access token with the minimum required permissions already selected. Add a note to remind yourself what the access token is for, and create the token and copy it.
